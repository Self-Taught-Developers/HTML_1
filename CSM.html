            <h2>What is Currency Strength Indicator</h2>
            <p>
                Currency Strength Meter is a technical indicator that determines the relative strength of currencies. It
                exists for MT4, MT5, and other trading platforms. Also can be found online at sites like this one.
            </p>
            <p>
                Realtime exchange rates are used to measure the aggregate, comparable strength. Simple meters may not
                use
                weighted calculations, while more advanced, like this one, use their weighting factors. Our calculation
                method also shows the direction of the change (denoted with an arrow close to the name of the currency).

            </p>
            <p>
                The algorithm looks at the previous 24 hours to calculate the overall strength and combines all currency
                pairs associated with a currency. The data obtained as a result of the calculations is usually displayed
                as
                a chart.

                Those who don't know what currency meters do - they measure main currencies' strengths in the Forex
                market
                (USD, GBP, EUR, CHF, JPY, CAD, NZD, and AUD) by comparing all 28 crosses between them. It's a quick way
                for
                Forex traders to see whether market conditions positively or negatively affect their positions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's look at how this technical indicator works and how it can help traders make informed trading
                decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are five steps in all:
            </p>
            <div class="div_list">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Identify the base currency.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Match the base currency with all available Forex pairs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Calculate the relative strength of each paired currency.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Calculate the average score.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use the result.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
                The basic idea of the strength meter is to think of it as a "filter" in decisions. It allows us to
                determine, for example, whether the US dollar is strengthening or weakening, which is always essential
                to
                know.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another thing to note is that a particular currency's strength is always determined by the timeframes
                you
                set for it. For example, EUR can be solid for today's timeframe, but it is one of the weakest on the
                list in
                monthly analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
                Depending on your Forex trading style, you may need to look at other time frames. If you are an intraday
                trader, you need more recent data. If you are a long-term trader, you need monthly values.
