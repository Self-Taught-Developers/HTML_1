            The currency strength meter is a graphical representation of the strength or weakness of currencies in the
            Forex market. You can see the relative strength of all majors.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Traders can use currency strength to predict currency movements when making decisions for the best
                trading opportunities.
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            You have real-time data for the current market, and you can decide which currency is under or overvalued.
            This is an excellent additional signal or filter in Forex technical analysis.

        <h2>WHat is Currency Strength Indicator</h2>
        <p>
            Currency Strength Meter is a technical indicator that determines the relative strength of currencies. It
            exists for MT4, MT5, and other trading platforms. Also can be found online at sites like this one.
        </p>
        <p>
            Realtime exchange rates are used to measure the aggregate, comparable strength. Simple meters may not use
            weighted calculations, while more advanced, like this one, use their weighting factors. Our calculation
            method also shows the direction of the change (denoted with an arrow close to the name of the currency).

        </p>
        <p>
            The algorithm looks at the previous 24 hours to calculate the overall strength and combines all currency
            pairs associated with a currency. The data obtained as a result of the calculations is usually displayed as
            a chart.

        <p>
            Those who don't know what currency meters do - they measure main currencies' strengths in the Forex market
            (USD, GBP, EUR, CHF, JPY, CAD, NZD, and AUD) by comparing all 28 crosses between them. It's a quick way for
            Forex traders to see whether market conditions positively or negatively affect their positions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's look at how this technical indicator works and how it can help traders make informed trading
            decisions.

            There are five steps in all:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Identify the base currency.
            </li>
            <li>
                Match the base currency with all available Forex pairs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Calculate the relative strength of each paired currency.
            </li>
            <li>
                Calculate the average score.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use the result.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The basic idea of the strength meter is to think of it as a "filter" in decisions. It allows us to
            determine, for example, whether the US dollar is strengthening or weakening, which is always essential to
            know.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another thing to note is that a particular currency's strength is always determined by the timeframes you
            set for it. For example, EUR can be solid for today's timeframe, but it is one of the weakest on the list in
            monthly analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Depending on your Forex trading style, you may need to look at other time frames. If you are an intraday
            trader, you need more recent data. If you are a long-term trader, you need monthly values.
        </p>
