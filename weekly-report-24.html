                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>IDEA</strong> - add the code for H1 calculation. Create new database TABLES for
                                other time frames
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                What I have done - add part of the code for H1 calculation based on the hour. Started to
                                create the code for the other time frames
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                PROBLEM - I have problem creating a solution that will work 100%. When to use the data
                                for Daily, Weekly and Monthly calculation. What is the best approach to stat
                                calculation. How to read precise date in the past based on the time frame needed.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                NEXT - So I have started to create one step by step and see how it goes. Test it and fix
                                it. Then improve and move forward with implementation based on the condition for
                                different time frame. Now I need to create the code for each time frame to save the data
                                into database after calculation is done.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>IDEA</strong> - add the code for saving data for different time frames into
                                database
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                What I have done - added tables inside the database for calculation for the different
                                timeframes. This will save data into tables on specific time frame so it is easier to
                                fetch the data from the database when needed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                PROBLEM - The issue I had today were not code related. Mostly it is the idea how to save
                                the data and when to save the data. How to create event when to save into 1H database,
                                when 4H database and so on. It is not easily to change the code so it checks specific
                                time frame and then calculate and save it.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                NEXT - Change the code based on the hour in the day. It needs to save data into 1H
                                database each hour. Make calculation for the 1H time frame. Then every 4H, every D1,
                                every W1 and MN time frame needs to make the calculation. This will need to be done by
                                using different dates with different hours. This needs to be coded properly so the
                                calculation is using correct data on specific hour.
                            </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>IDEA</strong> - solve the backend part to read the database data for
                                certain time frame select on the front end
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                What I have done - added SQL code to read the database based on the date and
                                hour. The data is pulled with last 8 records for each symbol.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                PROBLEM - The issue here is that I have database populated with the data for
                                strength on the H1 time frame. For other timeframes I do not have data saved.
                                Now I need to solve the issue how to save data for different time frames. Which
                                means I need to add more tables inside the database.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                NEXT - I am thinking should I add more tables inside the database for each time
                                frame, or should I make the calculation from the symbol database on request form
                                the front end. Third solution would be to have variable ready in memory with
                                calculated data for the basic request for each time frame. So when the user
                                calls the data it will be read from the variable. For now I am more inclined to
                                save it into database and later on I can add temporary variable for saving the
                                data to speed up the reading data and send it to the front end on the request.

                            <p>
                                <strong>IDEA</strong> - make a request from the frontend part for different time
                                frame for the currency strength
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                What I have done - added front end part with a drop down menu to select H1, H4,
                                D1, W1 and MN time frame. And send the data to the backend. AI have added
                                backend part to receive the variable and send the variable into the neccessary
                                function.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                PROBLEM - There was no too much issues.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                NEXT - Addid the part of the code to read the data from the database based on
                                the time frame select on the frontend
                            </p>
