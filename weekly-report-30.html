                                <strong>IDEA</strong> - create new bar chart
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                What I have done - using CHat GPT created new bar chart with only CSS and HTML without
                                chart.js. Then I have added the code into the project and put js code into separate .js
                                file and HTML into .ejs file and CSS into CSS file
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                PROBLEM - how to put ChatGPT code into the project where each code is put into separate
                                file and then to work
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                NEXT - create a code on the backend to use the database data for the bar chart that is
                                new created so it works with real data and not dummy data
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>IDEA</strong> - modify the code for the bar chart so it the width is narrower
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                What I have done - small modification inside CSS for the bar chart
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                PROBLEM - there were no problems with this task
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                NEXT - create new bar chart that will have columns divided into 10 small bars that will
                                show strength in percentage up to 100%. This way empty bars will represent weakness.
                                Filled bars will show the strength
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>IDEA</strong> - create a bar chart with only one value for each symbol I want to
                                show
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                What I have done - created new variables on the fron end in side .ejs file and inside
                                bar chart .js file. I have changed the previous line chart with an array into bar chart
                                with single value
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                PROBLEM - I did not know how to pass single value on the bar chart that way expecting
                                array for each symbol. I have searched for a solution and used ChatGPT to help me find
                                what is the cause. Befor that I was trying to understand the issue by having console.log
                                of variables received on the front end and they were sent successfuly as a single value
                                and not an array
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                NEXT - I need check the appearance of the bar chart. I would love to have bar chart
                                whith steps from minimum to maximum so the user can see the difference. And I want to
                                shift the lowest value symbol which now start from 0 and it is not visible on the bar
                                chart because it is set to 0.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>IDEA</strong> - add the new variables for each symbol in the backend and send to
                                front end that will show on bar chart. But sending only one value for each symbol
                                instead of an array
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                What I have done - created new variables for new bar chart type with only one value
                                inside each symbol. Then shifted the values for the maximum number in negative. And then
                                moved all varialbes for that amount so all symbols values start from 0. This will allow
                                me to create better bar chart in the future to have maximum and minimum bars
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                PROBLEM - how to extract the minimum value from an array. How to save only one value
                                from an array from specific place, last place in an array.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                NEXT - I need to send back end variable for bar chart to the front end and create new
                                bar chart with only one value for each of symbol I am using
                            </p>
