        <h1>HTML Free Code Camp Tutorial Review</h1>
        <a href="./index.html">Home Page</a>
            <p>In this article I will share with you my overview about the free code camp HTML course on Youtube.</p>
            <p>I will share details what I have learned and what were my questions that I did not understand in the HTML course. 
                This way I want to list all questions that needs to be answered to the beginners who start to learn HTML.</p>
            <p>I want to gather informations what I have learned in the tutorial so I can share that with you so you can learn also. I will put my knowledge here so this can help you understand in simple language that beginners can understand.</p>
        <h2>What is Missing in the Tutorial</h2>
        <p>At the start I would like to see all the steps I need to take. These are the steps I have took:</p>            
        <uo>
            <li>install Visual Studio Code "VS" code"</li> 
            <ol>
                <li>Would be nice to learn all the steps how to install VS Code on my PC. With steps and video if possible</li>
                <li>question - I wanted to indent to the right this first bullet point, but it seems that I cannot do it simply in HTML. I need CSS to add padding to the left.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Create folder on your PC and open it with the VS Code</li>
            <ol>
                <li>This folder will containt all files you create for this project</li>
            </ol>
            <uo>
                <li>Then create index.html file</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>This index.html should always be lowercase because server use index.html file as a first file when opening a website. This means server expects to have index.html file always</li>
                </ol>
            </uo>
        </uo>

        <h2>This is What I Have Learned</h2>
        <p>Each html page starts and end with html tag. Html tag is 
            <pre> <!-- <pre> tag makes the content in the block that is separated from other content. This make it stick out-->
                <!--Here I wanted to show <html> </html> as a text. So I have replaced < with &lt; and > with &gt; - this way I got what I wanted. 
                    And this is called HTML entities where I can replace certain html symbol to be rendered as a plain text-->
                &lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
            </pre>
        By making this sentence I have learned that there are &lt;pre&gt; tag that are used to show content that sticks out like the html tag above.
        </p>


        <!--This tag makes a horizontal line that helps divide the content-->
        <hr/>
        
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Because if I am a beginner I do not understand how to get around all the tools and applications you usually use.
            The instructor should have in mind that I do not know anything. And by that I mean now knowing how to create a folder inside VS Code.
