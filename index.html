                <!--If you want to make nested list you cannot use <ul> list under <ol>
                It will not work. But if you use <ul> under <ul> then you will have nested list-->
                <li>Here is my comment on the Traversy Media HTML Crash Course. As it looks there are missing basic steps that I think it would be very useful</li>
            </ol>

    <h2>What I do Not Know or Understand</h2>
    <p>As I have started I do not understand certain parts inside the HTML code:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Why we use !DOCTYPE at the start. What does it represents</li>
        <li>Why is html in the first paragraph together with the !DOCTYPE</li>
        <li>why do we have meta charset, meta name, meta content</li>
        <li>Details that are added inside the link element like the "rel", "type" wher I have added icon for a website. Now you can see website icon in the browser - "LTD" icon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What I Have Learned Up to Now</h2>
    <p>I see it would be good to write here what I have learned up to now to track the progress.</p>
    <uo>
        <li>5.2.2024 - how to add the icon for the website. It is added inside the head section, with link element. I had to upload the image icon inside the working folder so I can use in on the website.</li>
