    <h1>Welcome to Self-Taught Developer Website</h1>   

    <h2>Learning content</h2> <!-- This is heading 2-->
    <p>Here is a list with dates what I am learning and from where. This list will be as a guide what was learned, from where and what details I have learned</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I am learning HTML basics</li>        
        <li>
            <ul>
                <li>31.1.2024 Udemy Course Web Development - Only HTML part</li>
                <li>31.1.2024 Traversy Media Youtube HTML crash course - 1h long
                    <ul>
                        <!--If you want to make nested list you cannot use <ul> list under <ol>
                        It will not work. But if you use <ul> under <ul> then you will have nested list-->
                        <li>Here is my comment on the Traversy Media HTML Crash Course. As it looks there are missing basic steps that I think it would be very useful</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>1.2.2024 Free Code Camp HTML course - 4h long
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href ="./html-free-code-camp.html">Free Code Camp HTML Course Review</a> </li>
                        <li>5.2.2024 - added website icon inside the head section with link element</li>
                        <li>I have added Icon, but on the server I had an issue where image was not visible for some reason.
                            <br>
                        First it was the path to the image was not correct. I had to change that so it works on the server.
                        <br>
                        Then I have tested website on the link <a href ="https://validator.w3.org/">HTML Validator</a> which gave me details are there any errors on my HTML document. Which is great information to fix any errors on the HTML document - VS Code do not give these errors so this tool helped a lot.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    

    <h2>What I do Not Know or Understand</h2>
    <p>As I have started I do not understand certain parts inside the HTML code:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Why we use !DOCTYPE at the start. What does it represents</li>
        <li>Why is html in the first paragraph together with the !DOCTYPE</li>
        <li>why do we have meta charset, meta name, meta content</li>
        <li>Details that are added inside the link element like the "rel", "type" wher I have added icon for a website. Now you can see website icon in the browser - "LTD" icon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What I Have Learned Up to Now</h2>
    <p>I see it would be good to write here what I have learned up to now to track the progress.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>5.2.2024 - how to add the icon for the website. It is added inside the head section, with link element. I had to upload the image icon inside the working folder so I can use in on the website.</li>
    </ol>
