								<li>
									Here is my comment on the Traversy Media HTML Crash Course.
									As it looks there are missing basic steps that I think it
									would be very useful
								</li>
							</ul>

						<li>
							1.2.2024 Free Code Camp HTML course - 4h long
							<ul>
								<li>
									<a href="./html-free-code-camp.html">Free Code Camp HTML Course Review</a>
								</li>
								<li>
									5.2.2024 - added website icon inside the head section with
									link element
								</li>
								<li>
									I have added Icon, but on the server I had an issue where
									image was not visible for some reason.
									<br>
									First it was the path to the image was not correct. I had to
									change that so it works on the server.
									<br>
									Then I have tested website on the link
									<a href="https://validator.w3.org/">HTML Validator</a> which
									gave me details are there any errors on my HTML document.
									Which is great information to fix any errors in the HTML
									document - VS Code do not give these errors so this tool
									helped a lot.
									<br>
									Then I had an issue that I have put &lt;ol&gt; tag and
									&lt;&gt; inside ol and ul tag which is not allowed. I need
									to put them inside &lt;li&gt; tag
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							7.2.2024 HTML entities
							<ul>
								<li>
									There is "& nbsp ;" that I can use to add a space inside the
									paragraph. You can find more entities
									<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Entity">here</a>.
									Entities are additional tool you can see to insert inside
									the paragraps, like white space, writing HTML tags to be
									visible as a plain text. A helpful tool.
								</li>

								<li>
									Then we have other elements that I can use and those are: -
									&lt;abbr&gt; &lt;/abbr&gt; that gives me a way to add a text
									that you will see as a description if you move your mouse
									over that word. Just like the example here
									<abbr title="Mozilla Developer Network">MDN</abbr> where MDN
									has dots below and when you put your mouse over it, it will
									show what it means. - &lt;address&gt; &lt;/address&gt; is
									the second one tag element that I can use to have address in
									Italic. Like example here:

									<address>Dubrovnik, Croatia</address>
								</li>
								<li>
									List Types:
									<ul>
										<li>
											Unordered list - here is the tag element "&lt;ul&gt;
											&lt;/ul&gt;" and inside we add "&lt;li&gt; &lt;/li&gt;"
											tag
										</li>
										<li>
											Ordered list - here is the tag element"&lt;ol&gt;
											&lt;/ol&gt;" and inside we add "&lt;li&gt; &lt;/li&gt;"
											tag
										</li>
										<li>
											Description list - here is the tag element "&lt;dl&gt;
											&lt;/dl&gt;" and inside we add "&lt;dt&gt; &lt;/dt&gt;"
											tag which is description term dl, and then "&lt;dd&gt;
											&lt;/dd&gt;" which is description detail dd
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									New tag element "&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;" that makes
									word <strong>BOLD</strong> like this word.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							8.2.2024
							<ul>
								<li>
									HTML semantic section &lt;semantic&gt; to easily jump
									somewhere in the content with a link. Section tag element
									should have id ="xx" where xx is the ID name that will be
									used to jump to this section
								</li>
								<li>
									using # as a direct link to get to the top of the page. I
									have added at the bottom "Back to the top" that helps return
									at the start of the page
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							9.2.2024
							<ul>
								<li>
									Create about page and add content to it. Add download link,
									email address link, telephone number.
								</li>
								<li>
									add back to home link in the footer section by using /
									inside href element
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							12.2.2024
							<ul>
								<li>
									I have seen that on my GitHUB account I cannot see my
									coomits. ANd the reason was that my email address inside VS
									Code and Git was not the same as on GitHub account so Github
									did not count these commits to my progress. I needed to add
									new email address inside GitHub account so I have my history
									commits. And I have added new email address to my Git inside
									VS code that matches GitHub account so I have my commits
									registered inside GitHub progress bar.
								</li>
								<li>
									Today I have learned how to add images. Here is one example
									with the issue I had.
									<figure>
										<img src="/Images/Git%20new%20User%20commit.jpg"
											alt="Git new user and user email added" title="Git user and username added"
											width="574" height="262" loading="lazy">
										<figcaption>
											Added Git UserName and User Email Address
										</figcaption>
									</figure>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							13.2.2024
							<ul>
								<li>
									I have learned that if you have an image that contains
									space, like /Images/Git new User commit.jpg, you will get an
									error because of the space between words. To solve this
									issue you need to add %20 which replaces space in the name.
									So we would have /Images/Git%20new%20User%20commit.jpg
								</li>
								<li>
									adding header, main and footer section inside the code to
									divide the web page into three parts.
								</li>
								<li>
									adding aside-details-summary element that can be visible by
									clicking on that part of the text to show details of summary
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							14.2.2024
							<ul>
								<li>
									I have added a table with rows, columns and headers. I had an issue with prettier
									extension because when I have saved it did not indent properly. So i have enabled
									prettier in the settings of formatting . Then also select indent with tab inside
									prettier settings.
									I had an issue that prettier started to add slash on tag elements like img, meta.
									Which validator did not see as a good practice. So I needed to modify
									settings.json(to find this go to file->preferences->settings and in the search type
									settings.json). change the row by following this <a
										href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50261161/how-do-i-stop-prettier-from-formatting-html-files/66646608#66646608">instructions.
										After this the prettier will not add slash at the end of the tag element
									</a>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							15.2.2024
							<ul>
								<li>
									I have added several form types which are very useful. How to combine different
									options, how to create contact form. There are lots of forms, but I see that many of
									them are the standard I have seen on the internet. When making a selection with drop
									down menu
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							16.2.2024
							<ul>
								<li>
									Today I have continued with the free Code Camp tutorial and added few more form
									types. I have added button submit in the form. There are more form types, but they
									were not covered in this youtube tutorial.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							19.2.2024
							<ul>
								<li>
									started to learn CSS. Added CSS folder and .css file. Tested the <a
										href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">CSS Validator</a>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>

									It is important to learn basic stuff, foundation, because you learn what are basic
									terms you should use. Like when someone tells you semantic stuff in HTML, like
									element, attribute, tag etc... you will understand what he is talking about. Baisc
									knowledge is very important.
								</li>
								<li>
									I have started to learn CSS by following free code camp tutorial with Dave Gray who
									is good teacher and hes knows what he is talking about.
								</li>
								<li>
									I have started to work on my project by creating csm.html page. You can see it here
									on this website.
								</li>
								<li>
									I have decided to leave pure HTML and move to CSS because I think this would be good
									way. I am still thinking that I should go and work on more HTML projects before
									moving to CSS because I could learn more HTML with examples to stick in my head more
									combinations of what I have learned. Because example and small projects would help
									me understant the HTML topic in more details and I could later on easily use from my
									head what I would need and I would know better what is there to use in certain
									situtation. But, for now I will see how it goes with the CSS and maybe later I get
									back and work on HTML projects as a first step and then use CSS on them as a second
									step.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							21.2.2024
							<ul>
								<li>
									Today I feel I am not in a mood to learn more about HTML, but I would like to move
									forward and work on my project. And I do not want to learn and watch CSS tutorial.
									It seems that I need to change the way how I learn. This is something that comes and
									goes. Later on I will get back to tutorial and continue learning. This time I will
									shift for a while and change the routine.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							22.2.2024
							<p>
								currently added more details on the <a href="/csm.html"> CSM page</a> to look similar to
								the one I have picked as a template. I have gone through sections, then images, then
								list items. Now I need to fix the button and make modifications on the appearance. This
								is the next step
							</p>
							<p>
								What I have learned today is that it is not easy to learn at the start what is connected
								with what. What attributes are for DIV, for image, for list and so on inside CSS. There
								are some rules and there is experience needed to know what to use and what exists.
								Foundation knowledge and by that I mean school knowledge about CSS as a basic is very
								important. That gives you what exists so you can remember when thinking how to make
								something. Then you will know that you have seen it somewhere and you will search for
								it.

			<h2>What I do Not Know or Understand</h2>
			<p>
				As I have started I do not understand certain parts inside the HTML
				code:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Why we use !DOCTYPE at the start. What does it represents</li>
				<li>Why is html in the first paragraph together with the !DOCTYPE</li>
				<li>why do we have meta charset, meta name, meta content</li>
				<li>
					Details that are added inside the link element like the "rel",
					"type" wher I have added icon for a website. Now you can see website
					icon in the browser - "LTD" icon
				</li>
				<li>What means Render or Parsed</li>
				<li>
					how to create category page and add new pages inside that category
					so I can categorize pages on the live website
				</li>
				<li>
					when to use &lt;p&gt; tag and when not to use. Because I see when
					you have a href tag sometimes it is not used and sometimes it is
				</li>

		<section>
			<h2>CSS I do Not Know or Understand</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					12.2.2024 - is it possible to put image caption into center position
				</li>
				<li>
					20.2.2024 - I do not understand in CSS file which order to follow. Should I use HTML or body element
					at the top and then add others below or is there some rule that is good to follow when creating CSS
					classes
				</li>
				<li>
					21.2.2024 - Is there a logic or good practice how to start with the CSS on the website. Is it better
					to cover whole website page with sections and style them, then move to parahgraphs, then to lists
					and so on. One by one. Or move section on the website page and move to another section on the
					website page. Where I cover all different parts, like DIV, P, LI, and so on?

			<h2>What I Have Learned Up to Now</h2>
			<p>
				I see it would be good to write here what I have learned up to now to
				track the progress.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					5.2.2024 - how to add the icon for the website. It is added inside
					the head section, with link element. I had to upload the image icon
					inside the working folder so I can use in on the website.
				</li>
				<li>
					7.2.2024 - How to use some of the new tag elements like strong,
					description list, abbreviation tag
				</li>
				<li>
					8.2.2024 - how to use section tag element and how to use # to get to
					specific part of the page
				</li>
				<li>
					9.2.2024 - when to use &lt;p&gt; element - use it whenever you want
					to have space between text paragraphs. It will be nicely structured.
					Instead using &lt;br&gt; tag element and make a row as a space
					between the text it is best to use paragraph element
				</li>
				<li>
					12.2.2024 - added image with details like alt, size, caption, title,
					loading like lazy load
				</li>
				<li>
					13.2.2024 - added sections inside the web page, header, main,
					footer. Added element aside-details-summary
				</li>
				<li>
					14.2.2024 - added table.
					Happy Valentine Day
				</li>
				<li>

					<p>15.2.2024 - When listening the tutorial I see that to get the best results from the tutorial is
						to have your own project you want to make. That means if you watch tutorial that creates a table
						for something you should see how to make a table, but the design with how many rows and columns
						you should have as your idea.
					</p>
					<p>And build that idea with the basic knowledge about creating table from the tutorial. This will
						led to think more about how to combine the basic knowledge about creating table. It is better
						than to simply copy what is inside the tutorial.
					</p>
					<p>When you think on your own how to use basic knowledge how to create table you increase your brain
						power and start to combine the knowledge you have seen from the tutorial. This means you will
						think, create, remember how to create a table with the basic knowledge. And this will lead to
						learning more details and combinations how to create a table. This approach should be done with
						any tutorial
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					16.2.2024 - I have added few more form types, like checkbox and radio. Added button submit to send a
					form. Created weekly report video on youtube channel
				</li>
				<li>
					20.2.2024
					<p>
						when looking Udemy course from Angela Yu and free code camp where developers teaches
						I see a difference. The difference is in the type of teaching. Angel Yu teaches like in school
						where she touces details a lot of each topic. And you get pretty good foundatation and basic
						explanation.
					</p>
					<p>
						When watching free code camp and other developer tutorial you get real codes in examples, but
						without basic and foundation details that you would get in school. This means they are lacking
						with some informations.
						But this is not bad, but it is different tutorial so I see that it would be best to get both
						version of tutorials to get basic knowledge and experience. Combination is very good choice for
						beginners
