    <h2>What I do Not Know or Understand</h2>
    <p>As I have started I do not understand certain parts inside the HTML code:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Why we use !DOCTYPE at the start. What does it represents</li>
        <li>Why is html in the first paragraph together with the !DOCTYPE</li>
        <li>why do we have meta charset, meta name, meta content</li>
    </ul>
