        <h1>Self-Taught Developer Journey - Weekly Report 40</h1>

        <p>
            Here is a weekly report what I have done and what problems I have experienced. How I have solved those
            issue.

                                <strong>IDEA</strong> - change the code so the variables are populated at the server start. This way I will chart available for shwoing without needing to click the button to populate the data.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                What I have done - I have added one more function for each chart so when the server starts it will call this function to fetch the data from the server. The same function is called when a user clicks the button to fetch the data from the server.

                            <p>
                                PROBLEM - there is no problem this time 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                NEXT - I am planning to check the code and the values from the charts are they are doing ok and behaving as they should. I have seen that CSM line chart has issues. And that is when I hoover over the lines on the charts it changes the values on the chart. It seems thee is hoover issue. 
                                Second thing is to check resize functions on the charts so they are visible when I resize the chart. Especially if I put each chart into specific div I want to resize automatically this chart to that div window. This way I can move and put the chart whereever I want and the chart will look nice.

                                <strong>IDEA</strong> - change the code for the rest of the charts so each time a user request new data for the chart I get new data populated on the front end on the chart without reloading whole website page, but only the chart
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                What I have done - I have fetch function in order to get the new data from the database without refreshing the whole web page. This allowed me to have new content for the chart section inside webpage. For now I am using partisl .ejs and fetch function.

                            <p>
                                PROBLEM - there is no problem this time because I am using a template from the previous chart I have done. I am just using time to modify the current code for other charts
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                NEXT - Still one chart, CSM, to go and modify the code to fetch the data
