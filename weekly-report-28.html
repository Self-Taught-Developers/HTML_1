                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>IDEA</strong> - change the code for the bar chart to have better chart for the
                                users. And to do that I wanted to show only 1 value for each currency insted of showing
                                all values, like 10 values on the bar chart.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                What I have done - add the code to get the last result from each currency and to move
                                all values to start from 0 insteady having their real values.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                PROBLEM - I had no issues creating the code. I did not finish the whole code
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                NEXT - I need to continue working on the code to finish this part to show only one value
                                for each currency so I have bar chart with only one value of each currency. AFter that I
                                will need to modify the front part of the code to have much better bar chart looking

                                <strong>INFO</strong> - I was on a vacation a week before so I did not work on the
                                project. I started this week but I have spent time thinking how to make modifications on
                                the bar chart in order to show information on the bar chart much better than it is now.
